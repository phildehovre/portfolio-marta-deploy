      Originally from Belgium, I moved to London in 2010 after completing a Bachelor's degree in Human Ressources Management. <br /><br />
      I am a self-taught JS React/Redux developer but until recently, I was a professional freelance bass player. I played for top-rated UK functions bands for wedding, parties, corporate events as well as performed alongside a great number of independant artists in Europe, Asia and Africa. <br />

      I started studying web development in June of 2020 during the first lockdown in the UK. <br />
      I followed free html, CSS and JS courses on FreeCodeCamp.com, CodeSmith.com and testing myself on LeetCode. <br/>
      I was then encouraged to learn the React framework and assorted libraries (Redux, Redux-Form, Redux-Router) by taking Stephen Grider's full React/Redux course on Udemy, which I recently completed.
      I am capable of developing well-designed, user-friendly and intuitive web applications. You will find some examples of my projects by clicking the link below. <br />
